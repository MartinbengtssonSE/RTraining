# [1] Build an XGboost model on the same data set as the tutorial. Then, find out if we can improve performance of the model by tuning one of the parameters of your choosing.
# (can be alpha, lambda, etc. ). HINT: Leave all other hyperparamaters constant and do a "grid search" by running through a range of numbers and evaluate using a 
# Validation set. Then see which value of the paramater minimizes the cost function of your choosing. 













# [2] Optional: Build one other time-series model that we did not use in previous modules.
