Bunch of other interesting (more advanced) non-parametric frameworks that can be used for time-series analysis:
- (Vanilla) Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP)
- Long Short Term Memory (Recursive Neural Networks)
- Hidden Markov Chain Models (HMM) 
- Autoregressive Neural Networks (AR NN)
- Genetic Programming (GP)
