Hey! 

One final module to go. I promise this one will be easy.
We'll be shortly exploring an interactive visualization library that is created for R users, called Shiny. This could be a way for us to share the work you will be doing. 

I'll created an easy Shiny webpage in this module to get some feeling for front-end developing. Using the R library, our R code will be converted to html / css and put live as a dashboard.

Let's see what we can do!

Good luck.
