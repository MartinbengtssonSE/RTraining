Hi and welcome to your first R training! 

In this start-up module, I will show you some of the functions that R base has to offer. These functions are readily available, so no need to load any packages. You may recognize some of them from your online trainings. 

Start with tutorial.R first. You do not need to code yourself: just read along and try to understand what is going on. Then try practice.R where I've set up a few challenging practice exercises with some generated data. 

In case you really can't figure it out, you could consult stackoverflow. Here you'll find numerous solutions to practically all coding questions. 

I've also included a short tutorial on dplyr. Dplyr is one of the most popular packages in R that allows for really quick and easy data transformation / processing. You may find it easy to work with dplyr as its functions work very intuitively. 

Next training we'll be looking at retrieving data from a database. 

Good luck!
