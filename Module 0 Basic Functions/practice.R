# Let's practice! 

# Generate a sequence of numbers from 1 to 1000 and save to a variable called df. Hint: Use seq().


# Plot df in a line chart. Use plot().


# Compute and print the log of the 6th highest value. Hint: you could use order() to order a variable.


# Subtract 1 from all uneven numbers. Hint: Use modulus %% to find uneven numbers. 


# Add dates (starting point doesn't matter as long as it's a sequence) of the same length as your variable and add them together to make a data frame. 
# Hint: use seq again. "from" doesnt matter, use "length.out".


# Take the sqrt of the values in your data frame (overwrite the original values). 


# Remove all values above 15 from the data frame.


# Only keep each third row (1-4-7-10-13-etc) in your data frame. Hint: use seq().


# Remove the top 5 values in your data frame. Hint: Use order(y).


# Randomly shuffle the observations over the dates. Hint: use sample() and get just as many sampled values as the numbers of rows in your data set.


# Plot again. 


# Add a column "category" to df that equals "one" if the value column is within the top 30% quantile, and "two" otherwise. Hint: use ifelse().


# Check if the sum of the values in category "one" are larger than in category "two". Try using aggregate().
