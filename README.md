# R-Modules
Set of modules to get comfortable with data extraction (relational databases), transformation, and modelling.

Fork this repo and create your personal github repo and get started with Module 0.

Once you complete a module, commit and push your changes to your own repo and give me access. I'll check your answers and I will release the answers I came up with myself.

Good luck!

And now it's all mine. setup done to Github with git bash!
